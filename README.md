## About

The first year of teaching myself how to code was really hard because I didn't know where to start or what to look for. Even now, I'm still trying to figure it out, but I'm much more aware of my surroundings. 

Though I wasn't coding, I was collecting a bunch of resources for coding, getting familiar with the terminiology, and tweeting at folks here and there for some guidance. I've created this reference for future learners.

This is a list in progress, and I'll keep adding resources to it as I find them. Enjoy!
